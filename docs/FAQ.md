# FAQ

#### Can you provide more documentation?

Yes, I am currently working on more documentation. In the meanwhile feel free to ping me in the Slack channel #general and tag me with @rolandschuetz

#### Why aren't you using XYZ

If you have ideas how to improve the skeleton, please write me on slack or add a Github issue/pull request!

#### Why didn't you include Sitegeist.Monocle?

[Sitegeist.Monocle](https://github.com/sitegeist/Sitegeist.Monocle) is a great package and I recommend it for every bigger project, which is looking for a living style guide. For smaller projects and especially for beginners it's quite a big overhead and so this skeleton comes without Monocle.

#### Why are you using AFX and not Fluid/Fusion?

Neos gives you three possible rendering options: Fusion, Fluid, AFX. So now everyone can choose what they like the most.
Most core developers prefer AFX, same as Sitegeist, gesagt.getan and Code Q. This is an opinionated boilerplate. Of course iIf you donâ€™t like it, feel free to change it to what you prefer. You can also see our [Neos 3 legacy branch for a Fluid-base rendering](https://github.com/code-q-web-factory/Neos-Skeleton/tree/neos-3-fluid).

## Do you need help?
